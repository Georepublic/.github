## Reporting Problems
We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/georepublic) to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue. If possible please provide a minimal demo of the problem. Please follow these steps:

- Search the issues to see if your problem has already been reported. If so, add any extra context you might have found, or at least indicate that you too are having the problem. This will help us prioritize common issues.
- If your problem is unreported, create a new issue for it.
- In your report include explicit instructions to replicate your issue.
